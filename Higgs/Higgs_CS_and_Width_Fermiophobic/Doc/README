***SPLINE IS NOW AVAILABLE***



*********IMPORTANT*********
This FF version of the original HCSaW only contains the difference 
with respect to SM.  In this case, it means that only the widths
of H->bosons are available.  All other requests will return -1.
You must use the SM version of HCSaW if you need cross sections
(don't forget there is not gg->H in FF).



All XS are in pb.
All Widths are in GeV.

To use the class, you must include it into your C++ program
and compile with it. You must also compile with ROOT, as spline 
uses TSpline3.



There are functions for Higgs width, cross sections, and cross section errors (combined, scale, pdf).
To use in your program simple declare 

e.g.   HiggsCSandWidthFF *myCSWFF = new HiggsCSandWidthFF();

Then call the function you want

e.g.    bool spline = true;
	double TotalWidth = myCSWFF->HiggsWidth(0,<mH>,spline);

The following function are included:

  For width
        double HiggsWidth(int ID,double mH,spline);
        double HiggsBR(int ID,double mH,spline);

ID's for Width/BR are 

  /***********************IDs************************/
  /*                       Total = 0                */
  /*                   H->gamgam = 8                */
  /*                     H->gamZ = 9                */
  /*                       H->WW = 10               */
  /*                       H->ZZ = 11               */
  /**************************************************/


Only numbers for sqrts = 7 are given in this version.

NOTE: The HiggsWidth function returns width in GeV. 


double Width = myCSWFF->HiggsWidth(0,<mH>,spline);
double BR = myCSWFF->HiggsBR(<ID>,<mH>,spline);
