*********IMPORTANT*********
This FF version of the original HCSaW only contains the difference 
with respect to SM.  In this case, it means that only the widths
of H->bosons are available.  All other requests will return -1.
You must use the SM version of HCSaW if you need cross sections
(don't forget there is not gg->H in FF).



All XS are in pb.
All Widths are in GeV.

To use the class, you must include it into your C++ program
and compile with it.

e.g. 

#include "HiggsCSandWidthFermi.cc"

and then to compile

g++ -O2 -Wall -I<path to class>/Higgs_CS_and_Width_Fermiophobic/include -I<path to class>/Higgs_CS_and_Width_Fermiophobic/src -c <program name>.cc
g++ -o <program name>.exe <program name>.o 


There are functions for Higgs width, cross sections, and cross section errors (combined, scale, pdf).
To use in your program simple declare 

e.g.   HiggsCSandWidthFF *myCSWFF = new HiggsCSandWidthFF();

Then call the function you want

e.g.   double TotalWidth = myCSWFF->HiggsWidth(0,<mH>);

The following function are included:

  For width
        double HiggsWidth(int ID,double mH);

ID's for Width are 

  /***********************IDs************************/
  /*                       Total = 0                */
  /*                   H->gamgam = 8                */
  /*                     H->gamZ = 9                */
  /*                       H->WW = 10               */
  /*                       H->ZZ = 11               */
  /**************************************************/


Only numbers for sqrts = 7 are given in this version.

NOTE: The HiggsWidth function returns width in GeV. 
      If one wants the BR, they would use

double Width = myCSWFF->HiggsWidth(0,<mH>);
double BR = myCSWFF->HiggsWidth(<ID>,<mH>)/Width;
