Compiling NLOME is as simple as 

cd NLOME
./Install


An example .cc file is provided as well as fortran.
The .cc takes in a root file with a tree with four vectors of 
final state leptons. Order matters when passing to the code
(see .cc for details).  You can look at the Makefile to get an 
idea of how to compile with NLOME as a library.  This is just
designed as an example for you to get started using NLOME.
